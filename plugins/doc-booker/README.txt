The plugin allows users to input detailed doctor profiles, including bio, workplace, specialty, degree, and designation. Clinics can also be added with essential details like hotline numbers, emails, and locations integrated with Google Maps. DocBooker offers archive pages for both doctors and clinics, equipped with multiple filtering options, enabling users to search by category, exclude or include specific entries, and more.
A unique feature of the plugin is its custom image size generator for doctors and clinics, ensuring optimized visuals. Additionally, users can customize the slugs for both doctor and clinic post types, as well as modify the design dynamically. The shortcode generator feature allows unlimited shortcodes for showcasing doctors and clinics anywhere on the website, providing flexibility in displaying medical professionals and healthcare facilities.
